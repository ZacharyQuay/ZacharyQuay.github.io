		<p style="width:50%;">Welcome to my website! This is my multi-purpose website that has content from my education and my personal life. 
		The "Personal" tab contains mostly projects that I undertake or something I talk about that I find interseting. 
		This website, so far, contains things that I did and achieved in high school.
