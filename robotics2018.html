		â€‹Power Up was the name of the 2018 First Robotics Competition season. Each season consists of a theme with this year being 8-bit video games. Two alliances, red and blue, of three robots each, are pitted against each other in a symmetrical field. In this field, there is a scale and a switch which the robots are supposed to put power cubes on. Tipping the scale or switch in an alliance's favor causes them to progressively obtain points. There is also a rung where the three robots from an alliance need to pull on to raise a foot above the ground. There are also power up stations that give an alliance a power up. The three available power ups are Levitate, Force, and Boost. Levitate gives one robot on an alliances team a free climb on the rung. The force power up gives temporary ownership of the scale. The boost power up gives an additional one to two points for each second that the scale is owned. Each power up can be used with one to three power cubes except the levitate which requires three. Alliances can obtain power up cubes through the exchange. The exchange is a barrier between the field containing the robots and an alliance's field crews. A match between two alliances lasts two minutes and thirty seconds. The first fifteen seconds of the match the robot is autonomous and working on its own. The next 135 seconds is teleop where the robot is operated by the field crew. The goal is to get the most points in the allocated time.

	<h3>My Role</h3>
	<p class="tab">
		My role in my team was being the head of the machining team. Machining manufactured parts, mostly aluminium, for the robot. We manufactured most of the parts for the cube manipulator. The cube manipulator does the obvious, manipulate power cubes. The biggest thing we manufactured for the robot is the belly pan. It took three days to complete the castellated belly pan on the router. Additionally, we cut angle brackets on the mill.
