	<h3 style="text-align:center;">FIRST Deep Space 2019</h3>
	<p class="tab">
		For 2019, the FRC challenge was named Deep Space and therefore was space themed. The premise behind it is that the players are on planet Primus and they need to repair their spaceships to fill them up with cargo. The structure of the game is that two alliances, blue and red, of three robots per alliance, compete against each other to see who can score the most points in the playing area in two and a half minutes. Fifteen seconds of that time is the sandstorm period were the drivers of the robot cannot see their robot. The drivers would either use autonomous control or use video to see what the robot was seeing. The rest of the time after that, the robot drivers can see their robot. Points were scored with objects called game pieces. There were two different game pieces that required manipulation. The two-game pieces were called hatch panels and cargo. The hatch panel is a flat polycarbonate disc with a hole in the middle with loop tape around its edges. An orange rubber playground ball was the cargo. Points are given when a hatch panel is placed on a side of either a cargo ship or a rocket ship. Points are also given when scoring cargo in the cargo ship or space ship. Other ways to score points are by driving off and onto what is called the hab platforms which are platforms raised to different heights.

	<h3>The Robot</h3>
	<p class="tab">
		Our robot went through many different revisions before settling on one and even then, we made some major changes. The team’s goal was to have a robot that could manipulate both the hatch panels and cargo along with having the ability to climb to the highest platform level on the hab. Cargo manipulator worked very well but did require some tweaks to make it better. The climber was the feature of our robot that defined the robot at competitions. Teams recognized us as team 2152 S*M*A*S*H* when they saw the robot’s spider-like arms. We were one of the robots that took the least amount of time to get on the highest level of the hab platform. The hatch manipulator went through two major revisions. The first revision was called the hatch slapper. The hatch slapper pivoted on a point to slap a hatch panel with the hope of having it stick to the loop tape on the hatch slapper. Pistons were located on the slapper also to push the hatch panel from the hatch slapper to stick on the loop tape on the cargo ship and the space ship. The special functionality of our hatch manipulator, when compared to other robots, was that our hatch panel manipulator was able to pick up hatches from the ground. Hatch panels were also located at the player station where the robots could receive and pick up hatch panels. During the competition, we noticed that the functionality of picking up hatch panels from the ground was not very beneficial. This led to another revision. The next and final revision of the hatch manipulator was the hatch grabber. The hatch grabber grabbed hatches from the player station by grabbing the inside of the hole of the hatch panels.

	<h3>My Role</h3>
	<p class="tab">
		On my robotics team, I had the job of fabricating parts for the robot on two different CNC machines, a router and a mill, and a manual lathe. Most of the work was done on the router cutting aluminum brackets. To make aluminum brackets, 0.09 inches of flat aluminum stock was used. The first operation was creating pilot holes that will be finished with a drill press. The next step was to cut out the profile where we used a one flute endmill. The mill was used to make a few plates and other various pieces that required heavier operations. I did not operate the lathe this year as another member of the manufacturing team took that responsibility. Existing hex shafts were cut on the lathe.
