					<h4>Academy of Information Technology and Robotics (AITR)</h4>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						In high school, I was part of the AITR academy. AITR is structured so that the students learn at their own pace, pick their own technology specific tracks through a technology-based curriculum, learn life skills through engaging real-world curriculum, and other important skills through academy challenges. AITR is split up into six hexmesters which is AITRâ€™s version of semesters with each hexmester being six weeks long. Each hexmester, a challenge is presented to use to solve. Some challenges are listed below. 
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						AITR also has a First Robotics Competition (FRC) team, Team 2152 S*M*A*S*H*. I was part of the team for the 2018 FRC season, FIRST Power Up, and the 2019 season, Destination: Deep Space. For each season I was the head of the manufacturing team. The manufacturing team operates a CNC router and CNC mill along with a manual lathe. I oversaw and participated in the production of many different parts. I myself was producing a large portion of the parts.
